# PizzaFria
A simple podcast hosting page.

Most of this project (or at least the feed generation part) is based on the [django-podcasting project by rizumu](https://github.com/rizumu/django-podcasting). 
I just mingled around, fixed some things and added others for this to run on django 1.10 and to adjust it to the necesities of my project, 
for it to include a relation of the episodes and the panelist, and have a blog post for every episode.
